      "content": "If you've ever worked with images or files on the web, you've probably come across something called Base64. But what exactly is it?\n\nâœ… What Is Base64?\nBase64 is a way to encode binary data (like images or files) into a string of text that can be safely sent over the internet. Itâ€™s called \"Base64\" because it uses 64 characters (Aâ€“Z, aâ€“z, 0â€“9, +, and /) to represent data.\n\nðŸ”§ Why Use Base64?\nEmbedding images directly in HTML or CSS\n\nSending files via JSON or APIs (like our blog)\n\nAvoiding file uploads when you just want to test something quickly\n\nðŸ“· Example:\nHereâ€™s a tiny image encoded in Base64:\n\nbash\nCopy\nEdit\ndata:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAU...\nThis string can be used directly as an img tag source in your HTML!\n\nðŸ›  When to Avoid Base64\nWhile Base64 is super handy, itâ€™s not always the best for performance. It makes files about 33% larger, so itâ€™s better for small icons, previews, or testing.",
