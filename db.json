      "content": "When I first started coding, JavaScript felt like a mischievous genie—powerful but full of tricks. One moment I’m declaring let, the next I’m debugging an undefined variable inside a forEach. Nothing made sense… until it slowly did.\n\nLast week, I built a simple blog post manager. At first, I thought adding a post with text was enough. But then I wanted images. Then edit functionality. Then full CRUD. Each time, I thought I’d “finished,” I realized the app wasn’t truly usable.\n\nHere’s what I learned:\n\ninnerHTML isn’t magic—but it lets you structure content dynamically and beautifully.\n\nEditing images? Not just URLs! I learned to read FileReader outputs and store base64 strings.\n\nBreaking Git is part of learning. I had to pull --allow-unrelated-histories more times than I want to admit.\n\nComments matter. My future self thanks me every time I return to the code and see // dynamically create post detail view.\n\nI now understand one thing: coding isn’t about finishing—it’s about improving. Just like life.\n\nGibson out.",
